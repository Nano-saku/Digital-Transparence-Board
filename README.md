# 🚀 Getting Started

## Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* npm
* Git

Check your installations:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
git --version
```

---

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nano-saku/Digital-Transparence-Board.git
```

Enter the project directory:

```bash
cd Digital-Transparence-Board
```

---

## 2. Install Dependencies

Install the project's dependencies using:

```bash
npm install
```

For a clean installation based on the lock file:

```bash
npm ci
```

Do **not** manually install the packages listed in `package.json`. Running `npm install` or `npm ci` installs the required dependencies automatically.

---

# 🔐 Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for configuration and Supabase access.

Create a local `.env` file based on the provided example:

### Windows PowerShell

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

### macOS / Linux

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then open `.env` and configure the required values.

Example:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_supabase_publishable_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

### ⚠️ Important

**Never commit `.env` to Git.**

The repository's `.gitignore` is configured to ignore environment files:

```gitignore
.env
.env.*
!.env.example
```

The `.env.example` file may be committed because it should contain **placeholders only**, never real credentials.

### Service Role Key

The Supabase service-role key is highly privileged and must be kept secret.

**Never:**

* Commit it to Git
* Share it publicly
* Put it in frontend/client-side code
* Prefix it with `VITE_`

If a secret is accidentally committed or exposed, **rotate/revoke the affected credential immediately**.

---

# ▶️ Running the Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite will display the local development URL in the terminal, typically:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

Open the displayed URL in your browser.

---

# 📦 Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

---

# 🔍 Linting

Run ESLint:

```bash
npm run lint
```

---

# 🌿 Git & Environment File Safety

## Never commit `.env`

Before committing changes, check:

```bash
git status
```

You can verify whether `.env` is being tracked with:

```bash
git ls-files .env
```

If the command returns nothing, `.env` is not currently tracked.

If `.env` has already been tracked, remove it from Git tracking **without deleting your local file**:

```bash
git rm --cached .env
```

Then commit the change:

```bash
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Stop tracking environment configuration"
```

---

## Before Every Push

Recommended workflow:

```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push
```

Before pushing, make sure:

* `.env` is not listed as a staged file
* No API keys or passwords are present in the changes
* `.env.example` contains placeholders instead of real credentials

---

# 🔄 Development Workflow

When starting work:

```bash
git pull
```

Create a feature branch when appropriate:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

After making changes:

```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Add your change description"
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
```

For small team changes directly on `master`:

```bash
git pull
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push
```

Avoid force-pushing shared branches unless the team has explicitly agreed to rewrite the history.

---

# 🤝 Contributing

When contributing to the project:

1. Pull the latest changes before starting work.
2. Create a branch for significant features or fixes.
3. Keep commits focused and descriptive.
4. Do not commit credentials, API keys, passwords, or `.env` files.
5. Test your changes locally before pushing.
6. Keep the README and relevant documentation updated.
